# Core Modules

This directory contains the core algorithm implementations for the Wave Function Collapse library.

## Planned Modules

- `WFCEngine.lua` - Main algorithm implementation and coordination
- `PatternExtractor.lua` - Sample analysis and pattern generation
- `ConstraintSolver.lua` - Overlap rules and propagation logic
- `YieldManager.lua` - Performance optimization through yielding
- `WaveStateManager.lua` - Wave state tracking and management
- `EntropyCalculator.lua` - Entropy-based cell selection
- `PatternCollapser.lua` - Pattern selection and collapse logic

Each module will be implemented as a separate subtask according to the project plan.
