# Utility Modules

This directory contains utility functions and helper modules used throughout the WaveFold library.

## Planned Modules

- `PartComparison.lua` - Part similarity checking and hashing functions
- `GridManager.lua` - Spatial grid operations and coordinate management
- `MathHelpers.lua` - Mathematical utilities (entropy, probability calculations)
- `PartHash.lua` - Efficient part hashing for pattern identification
- `PartEquality.lua` - Part property comparison logic
- `SpatialGridBuilder.lua` - Building spatial grids from sample maps

These utilities provide the foundational operations needed by the core algorithm.
